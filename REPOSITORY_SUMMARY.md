# Knowledge Aggregation Platform Repository

## Repository Overview

This repository contains the complete codebase for the Intelligent Knowledge Aggregation Platform, a multi-agent system for knowledge management. The platform enables users to gather information from various sources, process it, build knowledge graphs, and explore relationships between entities and concepts.

## Key Components

### Backend
- **Coordinator**: Central component managing all agents and tasks
- **Agents**: Specialized workers for different functions:
  - **Scraper Agent**: Extracts content from web, PDFs, and academic sources
  - **Processor Agent**: Analyzes content with NLP to extract meaning
  - **Knowledge Agent**: Builds and maintains the knowledge graph
  - **Learning Agent**: Improves the knowledge model through continual learning
  - **UI Agent**: Handles frontend interactions via API and WebSockets

### Frontend
- React/Next.js application with TailwindCSS styling
- Interactive knowledge graph visualization using D3.js
- Search interface for knowledge exploration
- WebSocket connectivity for real-time updates

### Infrastructure
- RabbitMQ for message queuing
- Neo4j for knowledge graph storage
- MongoDB for document storage
- Redis for caching
- Weaviate for vector embeddings

## Recent Changes

1. **Agent Integration**:
   - Fixed the run_local.py script to properly initialize all agent types
   - Ensured proper configuration for all agent modules

2. **Blockchain Module Removal**:
   - Removed previously planned blockchain agent integration
   - This agent would have been used for providing immutable data storage and verification
   - Removed blockchain/__init__.py and references to it from run_local.py
   - Simplified run_local.py to not include blockchain agents

3. **Frontend Enhancements**:
   - Created comprehensive API client with TypeScript types
   - Added WebSocket manager for real-time updates
   - Built interactive knowledge graph visualization
   - Implemented search and explore interfaces
   - Updated dependencies and fixed type issues

4. **Documentation**:
   - Updated README.md with comprehensive instructions
   - Created IMPLEMENTED.md to track the implementation progress
   - Added detailed troubleshooting information

## How to Push These Changes to Git

1. Initialize a git repository (if not already done):
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

2. Add all files:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

3. Commit the changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Implement missing components and remove blockchain agent"
   ```

4. Add the remote repository (replace URL with your actual repository):
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/intelligent-knowledge-platform.git
   ```

5. Push to the main branch:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Future Directions

While the blockchain agent has been removed, the architecture remains flexible for future integration of blockchain or other technologies if needed. The current implementation focuses on providing a solid foundation with the core multi-agent system and knowledge graph capabilities.
