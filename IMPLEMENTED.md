# Implemented Components

This document summarizes the components that were implemented or fixed to complete the Intelligent Knowledge Aggregation Platform.

## Major Updates - Real Implementation Phase

### 1. DeepSeek LLM Integration

**Problem**: System was using placeholder Hugging Face integration with no real LLM functionality.

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive DeepSeek API integration:
- Created `coordinator/llm_client.py` with full DeepSeek API client
- Async chat completion with streaming support
- Named entity recognition using LLM
- Relation extraction between entities
- Text summarization capabilities  
- Sentiment analysis with confidence scoring
- Keyword extraction
- Error handling and rate limiting

### 2. Real PDF Processing

**Problem**: PDF scraper was returning placeholder/dummy content.

**Solution**: Implemented real PDF processing in `agents/scraper/pdf_scraper.py`:
- **PyPDF2** integration for basic text extraction and metadata
- **pdfplumber** for enhanced text extraction and table detection
- **PIL/Pillow** for image processing
- URL download capability with proper error handling
- Metadata extraction (title, author, creation date, etc.)
- Table extraction with structured data output
- Image detection and cataloging
- Fallback extraction methods for difficult PDFs
- Temporary file management and cleanup

### 3. Real Academic Paper Scraping

**Problem**: Academic scraper was returning mock data instead of real papers.

**Solution**: Implemented real academic scraping in `agents/scraper/academic_scraper.py`:
- **arXiv API** integration for paper search and download
- **scholarly** library for Google Scholar scraping
- **bibtexparser** for BibTeX file processing
- Real paper metadata extraction (authors, abstracts, citations)
- PDF full-text extraction integration
- Rate limiting and proxy support for scholarly
- Author-based and query-based search
- Citation and reference extraction
- Multiple academic source support

### 4. Enhanced NLP Processing

**Problem**: Entity recognizer and sentiment analyzer were using basic implementations.

**Solution**: Enhanced both processors with LLM integration:

#### Entity Recognizer (`agents/processor/entity_recognizer.py`):
- Combined NLTK traditional NER with DeepSeek LLM
- Intelligent entity merging from multiple sources
- Confidence scoring and source attribution
- Enhanced regex pattern matching
- Context extraction for entities

#### Sentiment Analyzer (`agents/processor/sentiment_analyzer.py`):
- Combined VADER sentiment analysis with DeepSeek LLM
- Confidence-weighted result combination
- Sentence-level sentiment analysis
- Enhanced emotion detection
- Disagreement handling between methods

### 5. Real API Endpoints

**Problem**: API endpoints were returning mock/placeholder data.

**Solution**: Implemented real functionality in `coordinator/api.py`:
- **Search endpoint**: Real task submission and result waiting
- **Graph overview**: Actual knowledge graph data retrieval
- **Node graph**: Real graph traversal with depth control
- **Entity details**: Actual entity lookup and properties
- Proper timeout handling and error responses
- Task status monitoring with async waiting
- Result format conversion and validation

### 6. Updated Dependencies

**Problem**: Missing dependencies for real functionality.

**Solution**: Enhanced `requirements.txt` with:
- **PDF Processing**: PyPDF2, pdfminer.six, pypdf, pdfplumber
- **Academic Sources**: arxiv, scholarly, bibtexparser
- **DeepSeek API**: openai (compatible), httpx
- **Image Processing**: pillow
- **Enhanced utilities**: tabulate, python-dateutil
- Removed frontend dependencies that shouldn't be in Python requirements

### 7. Configuration Updates

**Problem**: Configuration was missing LLM settings.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `coordinator/config.py` to use DeepSeek instead of OpenAI/HF
- Created `config.env.example` with all necessary environment variables
- Updated API port from 8000 to 3100 to match frontend expectations
- Added comprehensive configuration documentation
